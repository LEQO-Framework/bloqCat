 
Project Overview
================

Welcome to **bloqCat**, a modeling framework for quantum circuits designed to work with QASM3.

The goal of bloqCat is to simplify and streamline quantum circuit workflows by enabling:
- Easy parsing of QASM3 files
- Modular combination of circuits
- Flexible REST API-based interaction
